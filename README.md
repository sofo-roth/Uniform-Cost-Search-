# Uniform-Cost-Search-
A project about searching for a node in a node-tree with Uniform Cost Search, using Python.

Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is a type of uninformed search that performs a search based on the lowest path cost. UCS helps us find the path from the starting node to the goal node with the minimum path cost.
